Simulating power for 1. regressing bipolar disorder outcome on EA PRS and 2. regressing EA outcome on BIP PRS

Question:

If we have a BIP PRS (5% of variance in BIP) and a stronger EA PRS (15% of variance in EA\< about 60% of that within siblings), what are our expectations on power if we regress BIP on the EA PRS vs EA on the BIP PRS?

```{r}

###First, we calculate the power when regressing bipolar disorder outcome on EA PRS 

set.seed(123)

rep <- 1000 
#no of times to repeat the analysis 

output1 <- matrix(NA,nrow=rep,ncol=2)
#creating the matrix for the output

for (i in 1:rep) 
  { 

N <- 40000
#sample size


R2EA <- .15
R2BIP <- .05
#variance R2 obtained from latest GWASs.


PRS_EA <- rnorm(N,0,1)
EA <- sqrt(R2EA) * PRS_EA + sqrt(1-R2EA)*rnorm(N,0,1)

PRS_BIP <- rnorm(N,0,1)
BIP <- sqrt(R2BIP)*PRS_BIP + sqrt(1-R2BIP)*rnorm(N,0,1) 
#creating EA and BIP variables

BIP2 <- .1*EA + BIP
EA2 <- .1*BIP + EA
#assume that there is a slight positive correlation between EA and BIP

BIP_bin <- as.numeric(scale(BIP2) > qnorm(.99))
#converting the BIP variable into a dichotomous variable with a prevalence of ~1%

dataf <- cbind.data.frame(PRS_EA, PRS_BIP, EA2, BIP_bin)
#form into a dataframe

reg1 <- glm(BIP_bin ~ PRS_EA, data=dataf) 
#running the generalised linear model
  
output1[i,] <- summary(reg1)$coef[2,c(1,4)] 
#saving the estimate beta and p-value of the regression 
  
}

sum(output1[,2] < 0.05)/rep  
#calculting the power  

  
###Repeating all the above to calculate power for regressing EA outcome on BIP PRS 

set.seed(123)

rep <- 1000 
#no of times to repeat the analysis 

output2 <- matrix(NA,nrow=rep,ncol=2)
#creating the output matrix

for (i in 1:rep) 
{ 
N <- 40000
#sample size 

R2EA <- .15
R2BIP <- .05
#variance R2 obtained from latest GWASs.

PRS_EA <- rnorm(N,0,1)
EA <- sqrt(R2EA) * PRS_EA + sqrt(1-R2EA)*rnorm(N,0,1)

PRS_BIP <- rnorm(N,0,1)
BIP <- sqrt(R2BIP)*PRS_BIP + sqrt(1-R2BIP)*rnorm(N,0,1) 
#creating the EA and BIP variables

BIP2 <- .1*EA + BIP
EA2 <- .1*BIP + EA
#assume that there is a slight positive correlation between EA and BIP

dataf <- cbind.data.frame(PRS_BIP, EA2)
  
reg2 <- lm(EA2 ~ PRS_BIP, data=dataf) 
#running the regression

output2[i,] <- summary(reg2)$coef[2,c(1,4)] 
#saving the estimate beta and p-value of the regression

}

sum(output2[,2] < 0.05)/rep  
#calculating the power

```
