# Bipolar-Project-Simulation
We simulated data to calculate power for two different types of analyses to inform our study. This repository contains the R code for the simulations we ran. 

In our study, we aim to test the hypothesis that genetic liability for educational attainment (EA) and bipolar disorder are positively associated, until the onset of bipolar disorder, after which developing the illness disrupts schooling and subsequently, EA. 
We wished to use polygenic scores to check for shared genetic liabilities between EA and bipolar disorder. Two possible analytical methods exist for testing this hypothesis: 1. Using EA PGS to predict bipolar disorder in siblings discordant for bipolar disorder or alternatively, 2. Using bipolar disorder PGS to predict EA in a sample of siblings. One one hand, EA PGS is stronger than that of bipolar disorder, so we might have more power using EA PGS. But using EA as a continuous outcome might yield more power than bipolar disorder as a rare dichotomous outcome (with a prevalence of ~1%). To test which analysis method is more powered, we ran simulations using the code attached.
